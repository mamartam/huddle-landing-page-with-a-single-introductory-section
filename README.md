# Huddle landing page with a single introductory section
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies

- HTML5 — semantic markup
- CSS3 — Flexbox layout, media queries, responsive design
- BEM methodology — structured and maintainable class naming
- Google Fonts — Poppins font family
- SVG — inline icons for social media links

## 💻 The Process

This project helped me practice building and styling a responsive web page once again. Practicing responsive design is always valuable.

As with my previous projects, I started by reviewing the challenge requirements and thinking through how to organize the layout and overall structure. I explored all the materials provided by the `Frontend Mentor` platform and planned the sequence of my work before starting.

First, I created the `HTML structure`, added the main content, linked an `external CSS file`, and organized the project folders for styles and images.
Next, I focused on styling the `desktop version` of the page and then moved on to adapting the layout for mobile devices using media queries. Although `mobile-first` is often considered best practice, after reviewing the design requirements for different screen sizes, I decided that a `desktop-first approach` would be more practical for this particular project.

After completing the styling and responsiveness, I uploaded the finished project to `GitHub`.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Practiced creating desktop-first and responsive designs using media queries
- Gained more confidence in organizing styles with the BEM methodology
- Learned how to avoid unnecessary CSS duplication and keep styles cleaner
- Practiced working with inline SVG icons and styling them with CSS
- Improved my workflow by planning the structure before writing code

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?

- Apply a mobile-first approach in future projects where it better fits the design requirements
- Improve accessibility by adding more focus states and ARIA attributes where appropriate
- Optimize the CSS further by reducing long class names and grouping related styles
- Add subtle animations or transitions to enhance user interaction
- Refactor CSS using variables for colors and fonts to improve maintainability
